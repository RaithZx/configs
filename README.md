# configs ⚙️

This repo stores most of my config files that I use customizing certain applications.

The ideal use case would be that, every time I have to setup a new machine, I would clone this repo and avoid doing all the customization manually. 
But the truth is **I always forget that I have this repo 🙃**

Heres a list of programs included in this repo
Program Name| Filename
